Probability of extinction is affected both by species traits and network position. Invader role in home range is highly correlated to invasive range; generalist invaders may have hysteretic effects on networks, making removing invaders more difficult. Species-level and individual-level generality don't necessarily have to be the same thing; think about that! Interaction turnover is high in many systems; many times we see a conservation of species-level generality despite this turnover. Ecological boundaries between networks often don't follow human boundaries or at times even habitat boundaries; in many systems, we see higher connectence at habitat edges due to edge-generalists.",

(As I understand, it does this by drawing a network with the given constraints and then reassigning links according to rich-get-richer property until desired nestedness is reached). Then, they randomly parameterize them with LV-style population dynamics equations, and then step down pollinator growth rate to see community dynamics. Found that increasingly nested and connected networks are more likely to show one big community breakdown rather than many small ones (due to positive net effects between pollinators sustaining shared plant species). Also found these positive feedbacks caused hysterisis, with greater connectedness and nestedness also increasing degree of hysterisis. Findings support 'stress-gradient' hypothesis, where facultative  effects become more important as environment becomes more stressful. Cool marriage of critical transition theory with mutualistic network models.",

Looked at a super well-resolved plant-pollinator network observed in Illinois forest-prairie ecotone by Charles Robertson from 1884-1916. His data centers on plants, but includes pollinator survey from which they make assumptions about min and max pollinator flight period. They then randomly pull a shifted phenology from normal distributions of changes with means of 1, 2, and 3 weeks (plus randomly changed 10\% for some reason?) and looked at the gaps that were formed. Even under most conservative conditions, lots of species had gaps and/or curtailment of flight period. Discussion brings up some interesting points not addressed, chief among them probably being the potential for link rewiring under these new overlap conditions, as well as the potential (but at the time at least untested) idea that specialists may be more likely to shift more similarly to their partners than generalists. Honestly methods are seemed pretty crude today (this is 15 years old), but cool data source and super well cited.",

Theory on critical transitions have similarities, but we have lots of species rather than one characteristic time series; what's the right one. Reference says you can find it using latent features. Increase in both variability and autocorrelation can be predictors of critical slowing down (approaching transition). Variability is good for network stability, but counter to many managment incentives in practice.  Increase in nestedness may increase overall resilience of system, but also make the final breakdown of the system more dramatic (one big failure rather than successive small ones).

Also found differences in invasion probability across taxa/space, with islands being more likely to be invaded by animals while continents are more likely invaded by plants.
